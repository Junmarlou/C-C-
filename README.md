GROUP LIVE CODING TASK

1.	Getting the average of three numbers
Write the C++ source code that outputs the average of three numbers. Let the values of the three numbers be, 10, 20 and 45. The expected screen output is,
number 1 = 10 
number 2 = 20 
number 3 = 45 
Average is = 25 

2.	Output greatest value
Given three numbers, write a program that outputs the number with the greatest value among the three. Use the conditional ?: operator that we have studied so far (HINT: You will need to use two sets of ?: to solve this). For example, given the numbers 10, 23 and 5, your program should output,

number 1 = 10 
number 2 = 23 
number 3 = 5 
The highest number is = 23 

3.	Write a program that would input four numbers for variables W, X, Y, and Z, respectively, and exchange their values such that X goes into W, Y into X, Z into Y and W into Z.

4.	Workers at a particular company were given a 17.75% salary increase. Moreover, the increase was retroactive for 2 months, that is, effective 2 months ago. Write a program that takes the employee’s old salary as input and then output the amount of retroactive pay (balance) due the employee and his new salary as well.


5.	XYZ’s Pizza Parlor charges 12% service charge and 7% sales tax on the gross bill of its customer. Make a program that would input the gross bill of the customer and the amount given by the customer to the waiter. Program must output the customer’s net bill and his change.

6.	Write a program that would input the year and then indicate whether that year is a leap year or not.


7.	Write an application that prompts an employee for an hourly pay rate and hours worked. Compute gross pay (hours times rate), withholding tax, and net pay (gross pay minus withholding tax). Withholding tax is computed as a percentage of gross pay based on the following:

Gross Pay (Php)		Withholding (%)
	0 to 2000.00	10
	2001 to 4000	12
	4001 to 10000	15
	10001 and over	20	

8.	To avail of a college scholarship, an applicant must provide three figures: his NSAT score, monthly salary of his parents, and entrance examination score. The college may either decide to accept, reject, or further study his application based on the following conditions:
Rejected is any of the following exists:
a.	Parents’ salary is above 10,000
b.	NSAT score is below 90
c.	Entrance exam score is below 85

Accepted if all of the following are met:
a)	Parents’ salary is at most 3,500
b)	Average of NSAT and entrance exam is at least 91

Any application which is neither accepted nor rejected will be subjected for further study. Make a program that would input the NSAT score, parents’ salary and entrance exam score and then output whether the applicant is accepted, rejected or for further study. 
9.	An applicant will accepted to the Jedi Knight Military Academy is he is least 200 cm. tall; age is between 21 and 25, inclusive; and a citizen of the Planet Endor. However, if the applicant is a recommendee of Jedi Master Obi Wan, he is accepted automatically regardless of his height, age and citizenship. Write a program that would input the applicant’s height, age, citizenship code(“C” for citizen of Endor, “N” for non-citizen), and recommendee code (“R” for recommendee, “N” for non-recommendee) and then output whether the applicant is accepted or rejected. 

10.	Write a program that would input 10 numbers and then output the highest number. Output the lowest number as well.


11.	Write an application that displays all even numbers from 2 to 100 inclusive, and that starts a new line after every multiple of 20 (20, 40, 60, and 80).

12.	Mucho Dinero has P20,000.00 in his savings account. Write a program that would enter a series of numbers terminated by a 0 sentinel. A positive number would mean a deposit in his account and a negative number would mean a withdrawal. For each numbered entered the outstanding balance must be displayed. The program should also check whether the amount to be withdrawn has sufficient funds. If there is not, the message “INSUFFICIENT FUNDS!” must be displayed.


13.	Write a program that would display the number series below:

1     1     2     3     5     8     13     21     34   .   .   .   . 
A pattern must be established in displaying the numbers. The program will ask the user how many sequence he wants.

14.	JMC Enterprises has only 3 salesmen and for the month of July 2011, these 3 salesmen made 15 sales transaction combined. Make a program to input the 15 sales amount and the salesman code denoting the salesman who made the sales. Use code 1 for salesman1, code 2 for salesman 2 and code 3 for salesman 3. The program should validate the value of the sales amount (must be between 1000 and 99999) and salesman code (must be between 1 and 3). If invalid, display the message “INVALID ENTRY!” and then accept another value to disregard the invalid entry. Output the total sales using the format below:

JMC ENTERPRISES
TOTAL SALES FOR THE MONTH OF JULY 

	SALESMAN 1: (total number of salesman 1)
	SALESMAN 2: (total number of salesman 2)
	SALESMAN 3: (total number of salesman 3)
			-------------------------------------
		TOTAL: 	  (total sales for the month)

	SALESMAN WITH THE HIGHEST SALES: (salesman number)
